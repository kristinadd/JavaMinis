    // arrayManager[0] are the same reference, so it looks as if we managed to smuggle
    // a mere employee into the management ranks. That would be very badâ€”
    // calling arrayManager[0].setBonus(1000) would try to access a nonexistent
    // instance field and would corrupt neighboring memory.

    // type with which they were created, 
    // and they monitor that only compatible
    // references are stored into them. For example, the array created as new
    // Manager[10] remembers that it is an array of managers. Attempting to store an
    // Employee reference causes an ArrayStoreException.

    // Arrays Can Be Assigned to Superclass References In Java, you can assign an array of subclass references 
    // (e.g., Manager[]) to a reference of a superclass array (e.g., Employee[]) because a Manager is also an Employee.

    // Manager[] arrayManager = new Manager[10];
    // Employee[] team = arrayManager; // This is allowed because Manager extends Employee.
    // At this point:
    // Both arrayManager and team refer to the same array in memory.
    // Any change to the array through team will also reflect in arrayManager.
